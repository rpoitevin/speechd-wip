    <!-- CACHING -->

    <key name='cache-on' type='b'>
      <summary>Cache On</summary>
      <description>
        Festival output module supports a caching mechanism for
        repeated events like characters, keys and sound icons
        that saves the wavefiles retrieved from the synthesizer
        and uses them next time an identical request is issued.
        This way, the synthesis is much more responsive when
        you type in keys, you spell some word by going over it
        with cursor keys, sound icons are faster and so on.
        If you wish to enable this caching mechanism, turn
        cache-on to true, or switch it off by false.

    <key name='cache-max-kbytes' type='u'>
      <summary>Cache Max KBytes</summary>
      <description>
        How large should the memmory assigned to output module for
        cache should be. Festival will never overcome this limit.
        If there are more messages to save, the ones that are least
        accessed will be removed from the cache. So if you set this
        parameter too low, the module will often have to synthesize
        your request (which takes time) instead of just retrieving
        it from the cache, but you will save system resources. If you
        set it higher, it might make the module more responsive.
        The value is given in kilobytes, default is 10 megabytes.

    <key name='cache-distinguish-voices' type='b'>
      <summary>Cache Distinguish Voices</summary>
      <description>
        Normally, the cache pool is common for all voices, rates and
        pitches. This means that when for example the key 'r' gets cached,
        you change the voice and request the key 'r' again, it will be
        retrieved from the cache and you will hear the old 'r' instead of a
        new one. By default, it only switches between languages.  In most
        cases, this isn't a problem for characters, keys and sound icons and
        it saves system resources. But if you want to keep separate caches
        for different voices (and even rates and pitches), please set the
        corresponding parameters to true. (false means don't distinguish).

    <!-- FESTIVAL PERFORMANCE -->

    <key name='reopen-socket' type='b'>
      <summary>Reopen Socket</summary>
      <description>
        Switching reopen-socket to true will make the module close the
        connection to Festival each time the currently synthesized wavefile
        is no longer needed to finish and new text is waiting. This may improve
        Festival responsivity on slower machines, but might cause a more network
        trafic. Currently, the option is set to false by default, because there
        is a network problem in Festival socket communication layer that introduces
        unnecessary delays that affect the performance heavily in this mode.
        Unless your Festival is patched against this bug, switching this on
        is not recommended.

        If debug-save-output is set, it writes the produced sound tracks
        to /tmp/debug-festival-*.snd before it says them. You can later browse them
        for debugging purposes. They are numbered in order starting from 0.
